title: Bootup fun- dual-socket POWER9

<p>Well today it&rsquo;s going to be a short one.  For those of you out there who are like me and enjoy
watching systems boot, I&rsquo;ve recorded this brief (~3 minutes) bootup sequence of a dual-socket
POWER9 based system.  This was done through the CLI based OpenBMC console (<em>obmc-console-client</em>)
and we see the system progressing through the bootup sequence to a running instance of CentOS 7.</p>

<p>And for something a bit more esoteric another bootup video recorded a number of years back.
This time a MIPS-based IBM Workpad z50 booting NetBSD.  Definitely not a room heater, but
probably the best keyboard I&rsquo;ve used on a small form factor laptop - ironically the form
factor is referred to as &ldquo;hpc&rdquo;, which in this case stands for &ldquo;handheld pc&rdquo;.</p>
