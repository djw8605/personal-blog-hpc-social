title: ISC 2014- Auf Wiedersehen Leipzig
---

<p>I&rsquo;ve just returned from International Supercomputing 2014, which took place in
Leipzig, Germany.  As was the case in 2013, I greatly enjoyed my time at the
conference, and the hospitality in Leipzig.  It&rsquo;s a wonderful city to visit.</p>

<p>You will have read in my previous blogs about my experiences with ARM based
developer systems, and running IBM Platform LSF. For me, ISC 2014 was a very
interesting event for one big reason - variety! Variety is the spice
of life as they say.  And the variety in this case came from the displays at
OpenPOWER Foundation members Mellanox and NVIDIA, as well as servers based on
the the newly unveiled Applied Micro X-Gene 64-bit ARM processors.</p>

<p>Although small in size, the Tyan POWER8 motherboard with NVIDIA Tesla K40
installed made a strong statement. Although OpenPOWER was founded in 2013, we
are already seeing the benefits of this foundation - with a varied member
base including education, interconnect, and accelerator vendors - all with an
HPC pedigree.  With the rich set of members that is growing, these look to be
exciting times for the IBM POWER8 processor and the OpenPower Foundation.</p>

<p>For those of you who did not attend, the IBM booth had a number of live demos
including the IBM Platform Computing Cloud Service, which is built on top of
IBM SoftLayer infrastructure.  This service can provide both hybrid and
stand-alone clouds and is ideally suited for HPC workloads - as it&rsquo;s
non-virtualized.</p>

<p>So we say Auf Wiedersehen to Leipzig for now and look forward to the spice that New Orleans will provide this autumn; where there will surely be more exciting
things emerging from the OpenPower Foundation!</p>
