title: ISC 2013 wrapup- IBM Platform HPC and Intel Xeon Phi
---

<p>This past June at ISC 2013 the IBM booth featured live demonstration of IBM
Platform HPC V3.2 managing an IBM iDataplex cluster equipped with Intel Xeon
Phi coprocessors.</p>

<p>As part of the demonstration, the potential performance gains running an
application on Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors was shown by running the visually
stunning <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/embree-photo-realistic-ray-tracing-kernels">Intel Embree</a> <em>crown</em> rendering on Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon
Phi simultaneously.</p>

<p>IBM Platform HPC provides a unified web-based interface for deployment and
managment of the cluster.  Additionally, it includes application submission
templates to allow administrators the flexiblity to create templates to greatly simplify the submission of jobs for their users.  A number of templates for
well known ISV and open source applications are also included as standard.
For ISC, a template was created to allow Intel Embree to be easily launched
through the built-in workload manager for execution on Intel Xeon or
Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors.</p>

<p>Finally, when the processor intensive Intel Embree application was running,
the monitoring and reporting capabilities of IBM Platform HPC provided both
real time and historical reporting on the health of each node in the cluster,
including metrics specific to the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor such as
temperature, power consumption and utilization - all through a consistent
web-based interface.</p>
