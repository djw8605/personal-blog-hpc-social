<p>Super Computing 2013 has now come to a close. For those of you who were in
Denver, we hope that you had the opportunity to visit the IBM booth. Among
the many live demonstrations running at the IBM booth, there was a demo of
IBM Platform HPC for System x.</p>

<p>In addition to the demo running live on IBM NeXtScale, there was also a static
IBM NeXtScale system on display for people to touch and see.</p>

<p>The IBM Platform HPC demo featured IBM NeXtScale and the Weather Research
and Forecasting Model (WRF) application.</p>

<p>Even though SC13 has just wrapped up, I&rsquo;m already looking forward next years
events.</p>
