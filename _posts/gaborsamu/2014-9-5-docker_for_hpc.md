<p>With the recent release of Docker 1.0 and the broad industry backing from
organizations such as Red Hat and IBM, it&rsquo;s no wonder that interest in the use
and application of this Linux container technology continues to grow. Docker is
shipped with Red Hat Enterprise 7 and there exists a growing registry of <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/">Docker images</a> for a wide variety of applications.</p>

<p>For those who unfamiliar with Docker, itâ€™s essentially a container technology
for the Linux platform, which leverages existing and well proven technologies
such as control groups (cgroup), and LinuX Containers (LXC). Docker brings
these  technologies together and provides ease of setup, use and compelling
efficiency.</p>

<p>The IBM Platform Computing team has recently announced the availability of the
IBM Platform LSF and Docker integration, which is available as an open beta on
Service Management Connect. Supplementing the release of the integration is a
white paper which is focused on the suitability of Docker for high performance
computing (HPC) and includes an easy to follow, real world example of how to
run a Docker image under Platform LSF.</p>

<p>Happy tinkering!</p>
