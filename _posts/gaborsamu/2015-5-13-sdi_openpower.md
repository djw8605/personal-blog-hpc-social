title: IBM Software Defined Infrastructure- Put the POWER down and jump the chasm!
---

<p>OpenPOWER continues to put the power down and accelerate strongly in 2015.<br />
Earlier this year, the First Annual OpenPOWER Summit took place and more
recently Cabot Partners published the paper <a href="https://openpowerfoundation.org/crossing-the-performance-chasm-with-openpower/">Crossing the Performance Chasm with
OpenPOWER</a>, outlining the benefits of OpenPOWER for HPC. Reading through that
paper, one important point which stuck out were the considerations when
choosing a HPC system. It suggests that rather than using point benchmarks,
one must consider the performance of workflows across the HPC Data Life Cycle.  This seems a very sensible approach actually. Would you choose a car strictly
on it&rsquo;s 0-100km/h time? Well, when I was 16 years old probably yes. What
about braking, cornering, economy, safety? You need strong performance in all
categories. OpenPOWER Foundation achieves just this - by bringing together
organizations with broad expertise from accelerators, to interconnects around
IBM POWER server technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/spectrum-computing">IBM Software Defined Infrastructure</a> helps to wield the sword of OpenPOWER for high performance
computing workloads. Featuring broad OS/platform support including Linux on
POWER (Little Endian), IBM Platform Computing software products provide broad
capabilities including application management, infrastructure management, job
scheduling as well as monitoring and reporting.</p>

<p>Learn more about the IBM Software Defined Infrastructure for high performance
computing on OpenPOWER in this presentation from the OpenPOWER Summit.  Put
the POWER down and jump the chasm!</p>
