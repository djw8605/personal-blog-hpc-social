title: Looking back at ISC High-Performance 2015
---

<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed a good road trip. There&rsquo;s just something fun about jumping
in the car, and heading to a far off location. As they say, half of the fun is
just getting to your destination. My latest road trip brought me to
Frankfurt for ISC High-Performance 2015.</p>

<p>Crossing all of Austria as well as the southern part of Germany, this trip
proved to be no less exciting than the rest. Breaking down about 50 km from
Frankfurt due to a dead battery, I was fortunate enough to meet a local family
who helped to boost my car so that I could make it in time for the show.
Luckily I had some craft beer to reward them for their troubles. Of course,
part of the excitement this time was the fabled Autobahns of Germany.  Here I
could get up to some decent speeds - legally :)</p>

<p>Refreshments are always needed on long trips&hellip;</p>

<p>Frankfurt too had some interesting surprises in store - including the
interesting culinary treat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handk%C3%A4se">Handkäse mit Musik</a>, which is a sour milk cheese
served with onions. I&rsquo;ll let you read what the Musik part is all about. There
too is the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelschorle">Apfelsaftschorle</a> which I constantly mistook for beer at
the ISC High-Performance venue. Such is life :)</p>

<p>For me, where the rubber hit the road was the ISC High-Performance event. The
IBM booth (928) featured a refreshing bright yellow colour scheme, like the
dawning of a new era of High-Performance Computing built on Data Centric Systemsand OpenPOWER. In terms of demos, the IBM booth featured a number of live and
static demos including:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenPOWER HPC Server and Cirrascale GPU Developer System</li>
<li>IBM High Performance Services for HPC</li>
<li>IBM Data Engine for Analytics</li>
<li>IBM Watson tranSMART Transational Medicine Solution</li>
<li>Pluto (astrophysics hydrodynamics/magneto-hydrodynamics) running live on Power8 + GPU</li>
<li>OpenFOAM (CFD)</li>
<li>High Performance Storage System (HPSS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://openpowerfoundation.org/">OpenPOWER</a> hardware that was on the show floor attracted a lot of attention. Many people were impressed to behold the two Power8 systems which included
technology from OpenPOWER members Mellanox and NVIDIA.  You may have read about
my interest in Power and ARM based systems in some of my earlier blogs.</p>

<p>Being part of the IBM Platform Computing marketing team, I could frequently be
found at the IBM High Performance Services for HPC demo point. Here we
demonstrated our turnkey cloud solution for HPC workloads built in top of
the IBM SoftLayer cloud and featuring both IBM Platform LSF &amp; Platform Symphony workload management options.  The demo leveraged the work done by MINES
ParisTech and Transvalor to provide CFD services to French industry. You can
read more about how MINES ParisTech and Transvalor leverage the
IBM solutions for HPC <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/mines-paristech-and-transvalor">here</a>.</p>

<p>ISC also offered us the opportunity to showcase the IBM Platform LSF family of
products interactive conceptual demo to passersby. Here users could learn that
the Platform LSF family is not simply about workload management. For example,
Platform Process Manager and Platform Application Center, two add-on products
for Platform LSF help to boost user productivity through ease of use and
simplification.</p>

<p>So what’s next?  Toronto to Austin road trip for SC15?  Yeah, that doesn’t
sound like a bad idea.</p>

<p>See y’all in Texas!</p>
