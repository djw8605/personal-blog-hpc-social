title: HPC- Seeing is believing

<p>People who know me, know that I like to tinker. Whether it’s with cars,
computers or other mechanical gizmos, I’ve always enjoyed dismantling and
reassembling things - understanding what makes them tick. Maintaining classic
computers is a passion of mine and as you’ve seen in my previous blogs on that
topic, I’ve always tried to add an element of high performance computing when
tinkering with computers. Whether on a classic SPARC based laptop, MIPS
smartbook or a modern ARM developer board, there is a sense of achievement in
getting such systems installed in 2015 and successfully running a benchmark
for example. Even when running a simple home network, in this case with a wild
mix of machines, the importance of monitoring is apparent.</p>

<p>For organizations that make a considerable investment in high performance
computing infrastructure, monitoring this infrastructure and understanding
how it’s being used is of paramount importance. IBM Platform RTM is a
comprehensive monitoring, reporting and alerting software for HPC environments
running IBM Platform LSF. It takes the guess work out of HPC infrastructure
monitoring by aggregating system, workload as well as license consumption
information, all in a single tool.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a system admin or a line of business manager, this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/Z757K5YW">Technical
Brief</a> provides an in-depth look at the importance of comprehensive HPC
infrastructure monitoring - which allows organizations to correlate in a
single tool workload, system and license consumption metrics.</p>
