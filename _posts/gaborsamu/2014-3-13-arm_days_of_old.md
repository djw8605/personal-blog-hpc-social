title: Looking forward from the ARM days of old
---

<p>These days we often hear about CPUs based upon ARM cores.  They can be found
in mobile phones, embedded systems, laptops and even servers.  Indeed, projects such as <a href="https://www.montblanc-project.eu/">Mont Blanc</a> are investigating the
use of ARM based systems for high performance computing (HPC).</p>

<p>Back in the late 1980&rsquo;s, I was a student in high-school and a budding
computer scientist.  In those days, my view of the personal computer market
was ver North American centric.  Until one day I read about a new desktop
computer from the UK know as the Acorn Achimedes.  This system was based upon
a RISC CPU which was given the name ARM (Acorn RISC Machine).  The writeup in
the local <em>Toronto Computes!</em> newspaper indicated that Olivetti Canada was
bringing the Acorn Archimedes range to North America.  As luck would have it,
Olivetti was just down the road from me.  After after a few phone calls, I was
invited to their offices for some hands on time with a top of the line
<em>Acorn Archimedes 440</em>.  This was the start of my journey with ARM based
systems. The folks at Olivetti were kind enough let me use the <em>Archie</em> over a
number of days. During that time, I had a chance to try out a number of
different software products including games and productivity software. Overall,
I was greatly impressed by the Archie and it&rsquo;s operating system, RISC OS and
it&rsquo;s WIMP interface. One game in particular I remember quite well called
Zarch - which showed off the 3D graphics capabilities of the system.</p>

<p>The only catch for me was the list price of the system.  As I recall it was
around $2,500 CAD, which for me at the time was prohibitive.</p>

<p>Moving forward to 2014, I&rsquo;ve recently been tinkering with the ARM-based mini
PC <em>UDOO Quad</em> running Debian Wheezy EABI (hard-float).  This happens to
intersect with another area of interest, Technical Computing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll share more of my experiences with Udoo Quad in the coming weeks.</p>
