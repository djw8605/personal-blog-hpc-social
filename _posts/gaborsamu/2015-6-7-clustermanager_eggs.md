<p>Whether your HPC center is in Lilliput or Blefuscu, you&rsquo;ll appreciate the
importance of a flexible and easy-to-use cluster management solution to empower your populations. Administrators need software that will allow them to easily
setup, manage, monitor and maintain their infrastructure and ensure consistency for repeatable performance. With the varied workloads we see in modern HPC
centers, ranging from traditional HPC to Big Data and Analytics, organizations
may also consider building out heterogeneous environments, where different
hardware types are used for different workloads. As the OpenPOWER Foundation
grows, it stresses the overall importance of workflows across the HPC Data
Life Cycle - it&rsquo;s clear that when it comes to solutions for technical computing, it&rsquo;s no longer a one horse race.</p>

<p>IBM Platform Cluster Manager is powerful, easy-to-use infrastructure management for todayâ€™s scale out computing needs. The latest release of Platform Cluster
Manager V4.2.1 now provides the ability to manage mixed computing environments -
so whether you&rsquo;re running Linux on POWER Big-Endian or Little-Endian, the choice is yours. In fact, you can even deploy and seamlessly manage a mixed
infrastructure taking advantage of the latest IBM POWER8 and x86 systems.</p>

<p>Leveraging <a href="http://xcat.org/">xCAT</a> technology, Platform Cluster Manager can manage clusters ranging from &lsquo;Lilliputian&rsquo; in size all the way up to 2500 nodes. Platform Cluster
Manager Advanced Edition supports the automated creation of multiple clusters
on a shared infrastructure - allowing you to easily satisfy the business
requirements of Lilliputians and Blufescans.  For organizations with a single
HPC cluster, Platform Cluster Manager Standard Edition provides the ability to
quickly provision, run, manage and monitor a technical computing infrastructure with unprecedented ease.</p>

<p>For users taking advantage of IBM POWER8 systems, Platform Cluster Manager can
now provision PowerNV nodes as well as PowerKVM hypervisors, which provides
greater flexibility in infrastructure management and optimization. Further
enhancements in this release geared towards administrator productivity include
IBM POWER8 energy, PowerKVM and enhanced switch monitoring</p>

<p>So go ahead. With Platform Cluster Manager you can crack your eggs any way you
like.</p>
